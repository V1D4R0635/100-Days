    <h1>This Is What Autumn Feels Like</h1>

        Love is a walk in the park
        Pretty until it gets dark
        Love is a walk in the park
        'Til you get bit by a dog
        I never knew you could bark

        When the seasons change
        You won't feel the same at all

        Because summer will turn into fall
        Then you'll leave me, you're gone
        You don't need me at all
        Like the trees in the autumn breeze
        It's ironic the way that you leave

        Love is like riding a bike
        Scary but then it's alright
        I got the hang of it, right?
        'Til you start moving too fast
        Look up and you're 'bout to crash
        Why doesn't love ever last?
        So call me a pessimist
        I think I'm a realist living a lie
        Every night that I hold you inside of these arms
        Knowing too well you'll move on
        As soon as the warm weather's gone

        When the seasons change
        You won't feel the same at all

        Because summer will turn into fall
        Then you'll leave me, you're gone
        You don't need me at all
        Like the trees in the autumn breeze
        It's ironic the way that you leave
        Ooh-ooh, ooh-ah
        Like the trees in the autumn breeze
        It's ironic the way that you leave
        That's how I feel at the start
